# CMU-Math-Extravaganza-2019
### 28 February 2019

### TODO:
- [ ] Set up network boot with PiServer https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/piserver/
- [ ] Decide demos (Some at https://github.com/coloradomesa/math-extravaganza-2018)
- [ ] Build Print Off (Deadline is Friday)
- [ ] Create "layers" of improvement for demos we give them
    - We should build some/all of these ourselves in separate files and keep them around for demos or examples
  - [x] [Increase Character Vel/Accelerations](https://github.com/coloradomesa/CMU-Math-Extravaganza-2019/blob/master/karls/examples/ChangeSpeed.py)
  - [ ] Change Character Appearance -> Karl, help pls
  - [x] [Change Background](https://github.com/coloradomesa/CMU-Math-Extravaganza-2019/blob/master/karls/examples/Backgrounds.py)
  - [ ] Do monitors have speakers? -> Change noises?
  - [x] [Change buttons used](https://github.com/coloradomesa/CMU-Math-Extravaganza-2019/blob/master/karls/examples/AlternateButtons.py) (WASD?)
  - [x] [Change Dimensions of Window](https://github.com/coloradomesa/CMU-Math-Extravaganza-2019/blob/master/karls/examples/WindowDimensions.py)
    - I like this one because they would subsequently have to also change some parts in the code that move the character when they go offscreen
  - [x] [Add obstacles](https://github.com/coloradomesa/CMU-Math-Extravaganza-2019/blob/master/karls/examples/Obstacles.py) -> Added but needs graphical improvement
  - [x] Change so game is...
    - "[underwater](https://github.com/coloradomesa/CMU-Math-Extravaganza-2019/blob/master/karls/examples/UnderWater.py)" -> -1 * ay + Alternate Buttons
  - [ ] Add timer at top
    - I have no intention of actually using this one, maybe as a cool demo at the end showing what you can do with so little
