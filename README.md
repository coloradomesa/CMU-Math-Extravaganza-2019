# CMU-Math-Extravaganza-2019
### 28 February 2019

### TODO:
- [ ] Set up network boot with PiServer https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/piserver/
- [ ] Decide demos (Some at https://github.com/coloradomesa/math-extravaganza-2018)
- [ ] Build Print Off (Deadline is Friday)
- [ ] Create "layers" of improvement for demos we give them
    - We should build some/all of these ourselves in separate files and keep them around for demos or examples
  - [ ] Increase Character Vel/Accelerations
  - [ ] Change Character Appearance
  - [x] Change Background
  - [ ] Do monitors have speakers? -> Change noises?
  - [x] Change buttons used (WASD?)
  - [x] Change Dimensions of Window
    - I like this one because they would subsequently have to also change some parts in the code that move the character when they go offscreen
  - [ ] Add obstacles
  - [x] Change so game is...
    - "underwater" -> -1 * ay + Alternate Buttons
  - [ ] Add timer at top
    - I have no intention of actually using this one, maybe as a cool demo at the end showing what you can do with so little
